# Changelog

## v1.2 (pending) — Training strategies, mask-aware training, iOS support

### Training strategies

- **Strategy enum** — replaces the old `hybridRefine` boolean with an explicit
  strategy selector across all API surfaces: `classic`, `hybrid`, `mrnf`, `igsplus`.
  - Python: `TrainingConfig(strategy="mrnf")`
  - Swift: `config.strategy = 2` (0=Classic, 1=Hybrid, 2=MRNF, 3=IGS+)
  - C++/C: `config.strategy = 2`
  - CLI: `--strategy mrnf`
- **MRNF (Multi-Resolution Neural Fields)** — refine-window max-gradient accumulation,
  bounds estimation, bounds-aware pruning, long-axis split growth, configurable opacity
  and scale decay, continuous recycle, and dedicated means/scale LR scheduling.
- **IGS+ (Improved Gaussian Splatting)** — budget schedule computation, error-score
  accumulation, weighted donor sampling without replacement, long-axis-split-based
  growth, prune/reset behavior, and its own LR decay rule. Requires `maxSplats`.
- **Long-axis split kernel** — new Metal compute kernel for MRNF and IGS+ growth that
  splits gaussians along their longest axis. Includes native regression test covering
  transform symmetry, scale updates, opacity updates, and optimizer-state zeroing.
- **Hybrid refinement improvements** — growth floor control, improved mask-aware opacity
  suppression with background penalty gradients.
- **MRNF/IGS+ LichtFeld preset parity** — selecting a strategy auto-adjusts defaults to
  match LichtFeld Studio: MRNF sets `growFraction` 0.07, `maxSplats` 5M, `refineEvery` 200,
  and schedules scale LR; IGS+ sets `refineEvery` 500, `maxSplats` 4M. Explicit overrides
  are preserved.
- **Checkpoint format v2** — stores strategy-aware runtime state for MRNF and IGS+ so
  resume behavior is correct. Backward-compatible with v1 checkpoints.

### Quality & convergence

- **Mip-splatting** — `--mip-splatting` flag enables anti-aliased rendering with a reduced
  2D covariance filter (0.1 vs 0.3) and opacity compensation for the smaller blur. Implemented
  via Metal function constant for zero overhead when disabled.
- **Aux loss schedule** — final 10% of training automatically switches to pure L1 loss
  (SSIM weight → 0) for tighter per-pixel convergence (matches Brush `aux_loss_time=0.9`).
- **Background noise augmentation** — per-step random perturbation (±0.1) to the background
  color prevents splats from baking in a fixed background. Seeded per step for
  reproducibility.

### Mask-aware training

- **Per-pixel mask support** — masks (white=keep, black=ignore) are auto-discovered from
  a sibling `masks/` directory or specified via `--mask-dir`. Full pipeline:
  - CoreGraphics loader with luminance conversion (handles colored masks)
  - Undistortion through the same Brown-Conrady lens model as images
  - GPU upload and Metal shader integration: mask multiplied into both loss and gradient
  - Mask dimension validation with auto-resize on mismatch
- **Mask-weighted metrics** — PSNR, L1, and SSIM evaluation compute foreground-only
  quality. SSIM computes full Gaussian-window statistics on unmodified images, then
  masks the final per-pixel average to avoid corrupting blur statistics at boundaries.
- **SSIM backward mask pre-weighting** — pre-masks derivative fields before the backward
  convolution pass, preventing gradient bleed from masked-out regions.
- **SSIM backward background penalty** — soft `(1-mask)²` penalty pushes rendered values
  toward background color in masked-out regions.
- **Mask opacity penalty** — projects each splat center into a random subset of cameras
  (up to 8), penalizes opacity for splats consistently in background regions.
- **Auto black background** — when masks are detected and `--bg-color` is not explicitly
  set, automatically switches to black background.

### Alpha-channel rendering

- **`msplat_get_render_alpha`** — new API to read per-pixel alpha (1−T) from the most
  recent rasterizer pass.
- **Premultiplied RGBA buffer output** — `renderFromPoseToBuffer` and
  `renderWithFovToBuffer` output premultiplied-alpha RGBA for compositing, while
  `render` and `renderFromPose` continue to return RGB float32 buffers.

### iOS support

- **iOS cross-compilation** — `build-xcframework.sh` now builds both macOS and iOS arm64
  slices. Separate metallib resources per platform, selected at runtime via `#if os(iOS)`.
- **iOS demo app** (`demo-ios/`) — SwiftUI app demonstrating dataset loading from Files,
  training with progress, and real-time orbit rendering.
- **Swift package** gains iOS platform support and Accelerate framework linkage.

### Render API extensions

- **`renderWithFovToBuffer`** — render from a camera-to-world matrix at arbitrary
  resolution using a vertical FOV angle. Available in C++, C API, and Swift.
- **`renderWithIntrinsicsToBuffer`** — render with explicit intrinsics (fx, fy, cx, cy).
  Available in C++.
- Useful for orbit rendering at display-native resolution without a reference camera.

### Performance

- **Accelerate framework for image I/O** — `vDSP`/`cblas` for RGBA-to-float conversion,
  `vImage` for image/mask resizing, `CGImageSource` thumbnail API for subsample decode
  at reduced resolution.
- **Parallel camera loading** — `dispatch_apply` on GCD concurrent queue for image
  decoding (~5–8× speedup on M-series).
- **Parallel undistortion** — row-level GCD parallelism for Brown-Conrady undistortion.
- **Parallel KNN scales** — `dispatch_apply` for initial Gaussian scale computation from
  k-nearest-neighbor distances.
- **GPU pre-warming** — pre-warm GPU image caches at all progressive resolution levels
  after loading, then free CPU copies to reduce peak memory.
- **`maxCameras` parameter** — evenly subsample large datasets to cap memory usage.
- **Per-tile sort limit raised to 4096** — supports denser scenes (was 2048).
- **Lazy image loading** — cameras initialize with metadata only (intrinsics, dimensions,
  undistortion parameters). Pixel data is decoded from disk on demand via `reloadImage()`
  and released after GPU upload with `releaseCPUData()`, reducing peak CPU memory for
  large datasets.
- **Metal pipeline specialization** — forward and backward compute pipelines use Metal
  function constants (`fc_degrees_to_use`, `fc_has_mask`, `fc_mip_splatting`) for
  compile-time dead-code elimination. Pipelines are re-specialized when SH degree or
  mip-splatting mode changes.
- **Half-precision SSIM intermediates** — SSIM horizontal-pass statistics and backward
  derivative fields are stored as `half` (float16), halving intermediate buffer memory
  between the separable passes.
- **Loss readback removal** — eliminated unnecessary GPU→CPU synchronization for per-step
  loss values.

### Bug fixes

- **MTensor memory leak** — `__bridge_retained` → `__bridge` in allocator. `newBufferWithLength`
  already returns +1; the extra retain caused a leak since `CFRelease` only releases once.
- **Stack buffer overflow in KNN** — fixed for k > 4 by using `constexpr kMaxK = 16` for
  stack-allocated scratch buffers (was hardcoded to 4).
- **Dummy mask buffer leak** — cached the 1-element Metal buffer in `FusedTensorCache`
  instead of allocating a new `gpu_empty({1})` every iteration.
- **cam_pos alignment** — padded from `float[3]` to `float[4]` to satisfy Metal alignment.
- **Exception propagation in parallel loading** — `dispatch_apply` workers now capture
  exceptions via `std::exception_ptr` and rethrow after completion.
- **Demo autorelease leak** — wrapped orbit loop iterations in `autoreleasepool` to drain
  Metal command buffer autoreleases (fixed silent termination after ~5 minutes).
- **Metal shader warnings** — fixed 7 signed/unsigned comparisons and zero-initialized
  SIMD broadcast variables in rasterize backward kernels.

### Infrastructure

- **MTensor rule-of-five** — GPU-allocated tensors now own their Metal buffer and release
  it on destruction. Copies are non-owning aliases, moves transfer ownership.
- **CLI progress output** — stage-level progress messages (dataset loading, image loading,
  model init, training every 5%, saving).
- **Demo app improvements** — dataset picker UI (replaces hardcoded path), ported from
  C API to Swift bindings, frame-dropping for render thread backlog.

## v1.1.3 — Fused kernels + pre-allocated tile bins

- **Fused SH backward into Adam optimizer** — spherical harmonics gradients are now
  computed in registers and fed directly into Adam updates, eliminating a ~600 MB/iter
  device memory round-trip (at 1.5M gaussians).
- **Fused SSIM vertical-forward + horizontal-backward** — replaces two separate passes
  with a single kernel that recomputes V-conv from the H-buffer, saving ~130 MB/iter
  of intermediate buffer traffic.
- **Pre-allocated per-tile bins** — replaces the count→prefix-sum→scatter intersection
  pipeline with direct scatter to fixed-size per-tile bins. Eliminates 3 kernel
  dispatches and 3 memory barriers per iteration. `prefix_sort_pack` stage reduced
  from 19% to 10% of GPU time.
- **14–48% faster training** across mipnerf360 scenes. Improvement scales with gaussian
  count: garden 30K (3.5M gaussians) sees the largest speedup at 48%.
- **Per-stage GPU profiling** — `PROFILE_STAGES=1` enables Metal timestamp counter
  sampling per pipeline stage. Uses separate compute encoders on the same command buffer
  with `MTLComputePassDescriptor` for zero-overhead timestamp capture.
- **GPU timing instrumentation** — `PROFILE_GPU=1` adds completion handler timing to
  command buffers, reporting per-CB GPU execution time without affecting the
  `commitAndContinue` pipeline.

## v1.1.2

- Added `py.typed` marker (PEP 561) — type checkers now discover stubs automatically
- `TrainingConfig(bg_color=...)` now raises `ValueError` on wrong-size lists instead
  of silently falling back to the default

## v1.1.1

- Fixed `new[]`/`free()` mismatch in C API pixel buffer allocation — undefined
  behavior when Swift or other C callers freed render output with `free()`.
  Allocation now uses `malloc` consistently.
- Updated type stubs (`_core.pyi`) with `camera_pose` and `render_from_pose`
  methods added in v1.1.

## v1.1 — Arbitrary viewpoint rendering

- **`renderFromPose` API** — render from any camera-to-world matrix, not just dataset cameras.
  Uses intrinsics from a reference camera. Available across all surfaces:
  - C++: `trainer.renderFromPose(camToWorld, refCameraIndex)`
  - C API: `msplat_trainer_render_pose()`
  - Python: `trainer.render_from_pose(cam_to_world, ref_cam_idx=0)`
  - Swift: `trainer.renderFromPose(camToWorld:refCameraIndex:)`
- **`renderFromPoseToBuffer`** — zero-copy variant that writes directly into a
  caller-provided RGBA uint8 buffer. Eliminates intermediate float allocation for
  real-time display loops (400 FPS at full resolution on M4 Max).
  - C++: `trainer.renderFromPoseToBuffer(camToWorld, ref, outRGBA, &w, &h)`
  - C API: `msplat_trainer_render_pose_to_buffer()`
- **`cameraPose` accessor** — retrieve camera-to-world matrices from loaded datasets.
  - C++: `dataset.cameraPose(index, outMatrix)`
  - C API: `msplat_dataset_camera_pose()`
  - Python: `dataset.camera_pose(index)` → numpy `(4, 4)` float32
  - Swift: `dataset.cameraPose(at: index)` → `[Float]`
- **Demo app** (`demo/`) — macOS SwiftUI app for screen-recording hero videos.
  Live training with progress bar, then smooth circular camera orbit with FPS counter.

## v1.0 — Public release

Stable API across Python, Swift, and C++ surfaces.

## v0.6 — Bug fixes and API improvements

- Fixed SSIM Gaussian kernel — ported formula `floor((i - windowSize) / 2.0)`
  produced pairwise-duplicated values instead of a symmetric bell curve.
  Corrected to `i - windowSize / 2` in both Metal shader and CPU eval path.
- Fixed ASCII PLY reader — x coordinate used byte offset instead of token index,
  silently reading wrong values when x isn't the first property.
- Background color now configurable across all APIs (Python, Swift, C++, CLI).
  Default magenta `[0.613, 0.010, 0.398]` documented as intentional
  (high contrast for debugging under-reconstructed regions).
  - Python: `TrainingConfig(bg_color=[r, g, b])`
  - Swift: `config.bgColor = (r, g, b)`
  - CLI: `--bg-color R G B`
- `cleanup()` now safe to call multiple times (Python guard prevents double-free
  when manual call + atexit handler both fire)
- Added type stubs (`_core.pyi`) — IDEs now have autocompletion and type checking
  for the compiled extension module
- Documented `MTensor.view()` use-after-free risk (non-owning alias)

## v0.5 — Open-source cleanup

- Removed datasets from git (1+ GB of LFS-tracked files)
  - CI/release workflows now download garden dataset from Google Storage with caching

  - `exit(1)` on image load failure → `throw std::runtime_error` (safe for library consumers)
  - Deduplicated `getCachedMTensorImage` (3 copies) into `Camera::getGPUImage()` method
  - Removed debug `printf` on metallib load, commented-out `printf` in Metal shader
  - Deleted dead `msplat_model.hpp` alias header
  - Error messages to `stderr` instead of `stdout`
- Python API improvements
  - Removed always-zero `loss`/`psnr` fields from `TrainingStats`

  - Fixed `requires-python` from `>=3.10` to `>=3.12` (only supported versions)
  - Fixed SPDX license / classifier conflict in `pyproject.toml`
- Swift package: added render and export PLY tests (3 → 5 tests)
